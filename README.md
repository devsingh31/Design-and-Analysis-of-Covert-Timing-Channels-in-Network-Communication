# Design-and-Analysis-of-Covert-Timing-Channels-in-Network-Communication

Explored the design, engineering, and detection of covert communication channels, focusing on covert timing channels. The project involved creating a simulation of covert communication between two parties, over a
network, using inter-packet delays to encode secret messages. This simulation aimed to evade detection by authorities monitoring network traffic. The project required understanding steganography, statistical models, and implementing solutions in R, including generating and analyzing packet streams, and addressing challenges like buffer overflow and underflow.
